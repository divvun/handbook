== Getting debug logs from the end-user

Divvun Manager on Windows and macOS has a built-in function to generate a zip file of all logs and useful system information to assist in debugging issues.

- **On Windows**, Click the hambuger menu. **On MacOS**, click Help.
- Choose the "Generate debug zip file" option
- A warning appears explaining to the user what this is for, they should click OK
- They now select to save the ZIP file somewhere (desktop is selected by default)
- A popup explaining what has just happened appears, and copies 'feedback@divvun.no' to the clipboard
- They should now attach and send the ZIP file to an email and send it to us for review.

In the future, once GDPR compliance issues are sorted out, there will be a mechanism to automatically send this to Divvun via the Divvun API.
